Hi everyone! 

I am an incoming Research Associate at [Inclusion Economics India](https://krea.edu.in/ieindia/), where I will work on topics pertaining to Environment and Governance. I have completed my Masters in Economics from the University of Siena, and my research interests lie in the areas of macroeconomics, monetary economics and development. All my code pertaining to my completed and ongoing projects can be (soon) found here. 

I can be reached on Twitter [@MoharirAdvait](https://twitter.com/MoharirAdvait).
