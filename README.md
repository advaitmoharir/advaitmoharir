Hi everyone! 

I am a Research Associate at [Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning (CAFRAL)](https://www.cafral.org.in/), where I will work on topics pertaining monetary economics, macroeconomics and finance. I have completed my Masters in Economics from the University of Siena. All my code pertaining to my completed and ongoing projects can be (soon) found here.
